# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Milestone_2 has been added, it just defines a list of words and chooses one of them at random to be guessed. It also asks the user for an input (your guess) and verifies that it is a single character

Milestone_3 builds on the last update and iteratively checks the input is valid, if not it will ask for a new one. It now checks if the guess is in the random word, returning feedback based on the answer. The code is sorted into functions for increased simplicity and readibility


Milestone 4 adds new class, has lives, moer guesses and knows if the letter has been guessed
